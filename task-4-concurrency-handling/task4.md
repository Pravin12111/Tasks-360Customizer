# Task 4: Concurrency Handling

## Overview
In this task, we focus on developing a Node.js application that allows users to book events while ensuring that double bookings for the same event are prevented. This is crucial in applications where multiple users may try to book the same event simultaneously.

## Requirements
1. **Prevent Double Bookings**: The application must handle concurrent booking requests effectively to ensure that an event cannot be booked more than once at the same time.

2. **Database Integration**: We will use a database (e.g., Redis) for locking mechanisms to manage concurrent requests.

3. **User Input**: The application should accept user inputs such as `eventId` and `userId` for the booking process.

## Strategy for Concurrency Handling
To manage concurrency in our booking system, we will implement the following strategies:

### 1. Distributed Locking
We will utilize Redis as a distributed locking mechanism. When a user attempts to book an event, we will:
- Acquire a lock for the event using a unique lock key.
- If the lock is acquired successfully, proceed with the booking process.
- If the lock is already held (indicating another booking process is ongoing), respond with an error indicating the event is already booked.

### 2. Unique Constraint in Database
To further ensure that no duplicate bookings can occur:
- Implement a unique constraint in the database schema that combines `eventId` and `userId`.
- This will prevent any duplicates from being inserted, even if the locking mechanism fails for any reason.

## Example Implementation
Below is an example of how to implement concurrency handling using Node.js and Redis:
