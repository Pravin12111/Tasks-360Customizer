# Task 5: Error Handling in Node.js

## Overview
This task focuses on improving error handling in a Node.js user login function to provide more specific error responses to clients.

## Improvements in Error Handling
1. **Specific Error Responses**: Enhance the function to differentiate between various error scenarios, such as user not found and invalid password, and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
   
2. **Consistent Error Format**: Implement a consistent JSON structure for error responses to ensure clients can easily interpret error messages.
   
3. **Logging Errors**: Utilize a logging mechanism (e.g., `winston` or `morgan`) to log error details for debugging and monitoring.

4. **Try-Catch Blocks**: Surround the login logic with try-catch blocks to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent application crashes.

5. **User-Friendly Messages**: Provide user-friendly error messages that do not disclose sensitive information while being informative enough for troubleshooting.

## Importance of Differentiating Error Types
- **User Experience**: Differentiating between errors like "user not found" and "invalid password" helps users understand the nature of the issue and take corrective action.
  
- **Security**: By not revealing which part of the login process failed (e.g., whether the username exists), we mitigate risks such as account enumeration attacks.
  
- **Debugging and Support**: Specific error messages assist developers and support teams in quickly diagnosing and resolving issues in the application.
